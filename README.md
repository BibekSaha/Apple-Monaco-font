# Apple-Monaco-font

Apple Monaco Font is the best coding font according to me. I have extracted the .dfont from the mac and then converted into .ttf for widespread use.

This font is specially adjusted for Visual Studio Code for Windows and Linux.

I do not own the copyright to the font. All the right belong to Apple Inc., Use it at your own risk.
